	<h3>About</h3>

	<h4>Discord CLI</h4>
	<p>Discord CLI is a CLI version of Discord intended to be used with bot accounts (It doesn't work with user tokens
		as it uses the discord.js v13 libary), you will be able to log in with you bot's token and send/read messages,
		leave servers (bots can't join servers by their owns), manage roles and more. This project is developing since 5
		of december 2021 and you don't have the risk of your bot or your account getting banned! (If there is any risk
		I'll update this page)<br><br><b>Download link:</b> <i>Coming soon...</i></p>

	<h4>Discord CLI (User Accounts)</h4>
	<p>Discord CLI was the first version of Discord CLI where you could log in with your user token and send/read
		messages, join/leave servers and dms, manage roles (Was planned but not done), etc. Sadly I stopped developing
		it and I can't release it because it breaks Discord's ToS rules and because the risk of users using it getting
		banned...<br><br><b>Download link:</b> <i>Not Available and probably never going to be...</i></p>
