	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>"CLI Apps" is the name that I set to a bunch of Command Line Interfaced Applications I am/was working on. Down
		here you will find some apps and their descriptions.

	<h4>Easy Legendary</h4>
	<p>Easy Legendary is a CLI and Epic Games Launcher alternative, it execute legendary-gl's commands for you in a
		simple interface, not everyone likes executing and memorizing commands! It's free and open-source but it only
		works on Windows 8.1 and up, this tool is up-to-date and you can use it alongside Epic Games Launcher or a previous
		installation of legendary-gl! This tool is coded in JavaScript but you don't need Node.js, only Python 3.8 or higher
		as legendary-gl needs it.

	<h4>Discord CLI</h4>
	<p>Discord CLI is a CLI version of Discord intended to be used with bot accounts (It doesn't work with user tokens
		as it uses the discord.js v13 libary), you will be able to log in with you bot's token and send/read messages,
		leave servers (bots can't join servers by their owns), manage roles and more. This project is developing since 5
		of december 2021 and you don't have the risk of your bot or your account getting banned! (If there is any risk
		I'll update this page)<br><br><b>Download link:</b> <i>Coming soon...</i>
		
		(<b>Update 12-Aug-22:</b> discord.js v14 released a little while ago and I am starting development now!)

	<h4>Discord CLI (User Accounts)</h4>
	<p>Discord CLI was the first version of Discord CLI where you could log in with your user token and send/read
		messages, join/leave servers and dms, manage roles (Was planned but not done), etc. Sadly I stopped developing
		it and I can't release it because it breaks Discord's ToS rules and because the risk of users using it getting
		banned...<br><br><b>Download link:</b> <i>Not Available.</i>
