	<h3>What's this?</h3>
	<p>
		Well, this is my webpage (A garbage one)! Here you can find my proyects and their download links (If available)
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Who are you?</h3>
	<p>
		I'm AngelCMHxD, a person that likes programing, here is <a
			onclick="window.open('https://github.com/AngelCMHxD/', '_blank').focus()" style="color: cyan;"><u>my github
				page</u></a> if you want to read more about me.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Where are your proyects?</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="./proyects.html" style="color: cyan;">Right here!</a>
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>I'm a programmer too! How can I help you?</h3>
	<p>
		If the proyect is public on my github account it means that you can help me by doing PR (Pull Requests)!
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>I'm not a programmer, can I help?</h3>
	<p>
		Of course you can! You are already helping me by using my proyects, I would apreciate very much If you share
		them! Do you want to help me more? You can send me bugs that you find on my projects in order to fix them! Do
		you want to help me even more? Sadly I don't know how you can help me even more but thanks!
